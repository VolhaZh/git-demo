Babe I'm Gonna Leave You
Babe, baby, baby, I'm Gonna Leave You.
I said baby, you know I'm gonna leave you.
I'll leave you when the summertime,
Leave you when the summertime comes arollin'
Leave you when the summer comes along.

Baby, baby, I don't wanna leave you,
I ain't jokin' woman, I got to ramble.
Oh, yeah, baby, baby, I won't be there,
Really got to ramble.
I can hear it callin' me the way it used to do,
I can hear it callin' me back home.

I know, I never leave you, baby.
But I got to go away from this place, I've got to quit you.
Ooh, baby,
Baby, ooh don't you hear it callin'?
